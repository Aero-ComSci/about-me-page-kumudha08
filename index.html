    <h2> Career Goals</h2>
    <p> 
        When I grow up I want to be in a proffession relating to law, like a civil litigator or a defence attorney. I find law quite interesting, escpecially how carefully crafted words, phrases and sentences can affect whole lives, societies, and the workings of nations. I think law is a profession where an induvidual can express both their own opinions and advocate for the benefit of others, both of which are things that I really value in life. Another one of my career goals is to become an author and write books. While this wouldn't be my sole career, I would definetely write books as a sort of side job or hobby, as it has been one of my dreams since I was a kid. It would also be beneficial for me since it would help me retain my love for books and reading, as well as writing.
    </p>

    <h2> Characteristics and Strengths </h2>
    <p>
        As an induvidual, I possess many qualities that can be helpful in my future, and that can benefit the betterment of the people around me. For instance, I am a very adaptable and resourceful person. Having grown up with a sibling and several younger cousins, I have learnt to adjust to certain situations and make sacrifices to benefit others. I am also a very efficient person, and I work well under pressure. Furthermore, I pay attention to detail and finish everything I start with a focused mind. I am also known to be exetremely empathetic, having been more mature than anyone else my age throughout my childhood.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Achievments and Work Skills</h2>
    <p> I like to think of myself as a team player who also possess their own ambitions and values. This is something that has been implimented in all aspects of my life, from spending time with my family or friends, making sure school group projects get done efficiently, and playing for each other in a basketball team. My ethics have also helped me pick up some achievements in my lifetime. I made the Honor Roll in all quarters in my Middle School, won awards in San Jose's Tech Interactive's Tech Challenge (including a year where my team won the entire challenge), and have performed in multiple concerts of Indian Classical Music. I am also one of the captains of Emerald High School's first basketball team, and graduated DACA's swim academy with a Gold Award. Furthermore, as a Girl Scout with various journeys and completed skills, I have accquired a skill set that would be exetremely helpful in multiple areas of my life.  </p>
